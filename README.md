# Degree Scale
Degree Scale is designed to help students of all ages choose the right college Major and degree level, the first time. 


## How does it work?
The app allows you to create an account and see what types of jobs and income different people are getting with their college degree, by viewing user reviews. You can also view the salary difference between a bachelors and asociates degree of the same major, along with the average cost and graduation rate. This information is calculated from data pulled from college scorecards API. 

The goal is to help students or potential students save precious time and money by choosing the right major and degree level to best suite their life goals.


## User Stories
